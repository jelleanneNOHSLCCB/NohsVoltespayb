    <div class="section-heading">
        <h3>Early Beginnings (1901–1902)</h3>
        <p>Negros Occidental High School, located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, Philippines, is the oldest public secondary school in the province. Its establishment began with educational reforms during the early American colonial period. In 1901, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. 372, empowering provincial boards to fund secondary schools across the Philippines — including in Negros Occidental. The foundation for a provincial high school was prepared by Division Superintendent George W. Beattie, who arranged funds and teachers for the first year of operation. </p>

        <h4>Founding and Early Years (1902–1903)</h4>
        <p>On July 1, 1902, the school officially opened its doors with 125 students and three American teachers under the first principal, Mr. Ray Howell, one of the Thomasites — trained educators sent from the United States to develop the public school system. At its founding, the school was originally named “Instituto Rizal”, after the Philippine national hero Dr. José Rizal. Early classes and dormitories were held in rented buildings, including space provided by local leaders Antonio Ledesma Jayme and Melecio Severino. However, the school faced challenges in its first year. It temporarily closed from September 7 to November 10, 1902 due to a cholera epidemic. By July 1903, it had reopened with increased enrollment and staffing. </p>

        <h5>Name Changes and Growth (1905–1931)</h5>
        <p>In compliance with the changing educational policies of the American colonial government, Instituto Rizal became officially known as the “Rizal Institute” after Executive Order No. 44 in 1912, which further standardized English and school naming conventions. By 1927, plans were underway for a permanent campus. Construction was completed by 1931, and the school transferred to its present site along Araneta Street in Bacolod. The building facade was inscribed with the name “Bacolod High School”, though the institution continued to be referred to in official communications as Negros Occidental High School.</p>

        <h6>Mid-20th Century Changes</h6>
        <h7>In 1970, RA 5694 converted the school into a national high school under the name Negros Occidental General Comprehensive High School (NOGCHS). This change was opposed by alumni and the community. After more than a decade of legal and legislative efforts, Batas Pambansa Blg. 333 (approved January 19, 1983) restored the name to Negros Occidental High School, the title it holds today.</h7>
